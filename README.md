# a11y-js

Incredibly fast and precise universal web accessibility evaluator for puppeteer or playwright üèéÔ∏è üåé.

Getting Started: checkout the [playwright-example](./a11y-js/tests/basic-playwright.spec.ts) or [puppeteer](./a11y-js/tests/basic.ts)

Over 150-1000% faster than other accessibility runners like `@axe-core/playwright` or `pa11y` along with [10-48%](./a11y-js/test-results) increase on issues found. 

If you want to use a browser make sure to have [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) or [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) installed.

```sh
npm i a11y-js --save
```

Requires node ^13

```js
import { a11y, goToPage } from "a11y-js"

// puppeteer or playwright page
const page = await browser.newPage();

// optional navigate with request interception. You can also already have an active page open.
await goToPage({ page, timeout: 15000 }, "https://www.drake.com")
// or use page.setContent("<html>...</html>") instead if you already have the content.

const results = await a11y({ page, browser, runners: ["htmlcs", "axe"], includeWarnings: true, ...extraConfigs })
```

```js
// sample of results for an audit.
const results = {
  documentTitle: 'Drake Industries | Custom, Durable, High-Quality Labels, Asset Tags and Custom Server Bezels',
  pageUrl: 'https://drake.com',
  issues: [

## Configuration

The `extraConfigs` object has the following:

```ts
type RunnerConfig = {
  browser: Browser; // puppeteer or playwright Browser Object.
  page: Page; // puppeteer or playwright Page Object.
  actions?: string[]; // custom actions or actions from lib/actions
  hideElements?: string; // hide elements from rendering like modals using css.
  ignore?: string[]; // ignore certain rules from running.
  includeNotices?: boolean; // include notices
  includeWarnings?: boolean; // include warnings
  rootElement?: string; // the entry point.
  rules?: string; // what rules you want to include: default all.
  runners?: string[]; // type of runner to use axe, htmlcs, or custom
  standard?: Standard; // web accessibility standard WCAG2A, WCAG2AA, WCAG2AAA, or Section508
  timeout?: number; // timeout for running the audit.
  origin?: string; // the origin of the page.
  language?: string; // the language to use for testing and getting localized data in.
  noIntercept?: boolean; // skip setting up request interception.
};

```

## Runners

a11y supports multiple test runners which return different results. The built-in test runners are:

- [`a11y-js`](./a11y-js/README.md) core.
- [`fast_axecore`](./fast_htmlcs/README.md): run tests using [axe-core](./lib/runners/axe.ts).
- [`fast_htmlcs`](./fast_htmlcs/README.md): run tests using [HTML CodeSniffer](./lib/runners/htmlcs.ts)

If you run [@playwright/axe-core](./a11y-js/tests/axecore-playwright.spec.ts) vs [our custom axe-core](./a11y-js/tests/basic-axe-playwright.spec.ts) setup of axe the issues run over 90% faster over 20 runs by default with improved resolution of issues. The performance scales the larger the page.

For the mock test case used `@playwright/axe-core` found 2 errors while `fast_axecore` or our custom version of it found 6 errors using a small [sample mock](./a11y-js/tests/html-small-mock.ts).

The issues are sorted displaying the following order "issues", "warnings", and "notices". The sorting is done with an efficient algorithm leveraging the js engine with `setImmediate` instead of the standard `.sort` method for arrays.

## i18n

[Locales](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n) supported by the runner using pre-compiled locales. In order to pre-compile the locales run `./build.sh`. Some locales are only available in certain runners. Our goal is to unify the languages and eventually unify the runners in a way that we can get 
the best aspects of testing without worrying about a `name`.

## Performance

This project is the fastest web accessibility runner OSS. The `htmlcs` and `axe-core` handling of the runners runs faster due to bug fixes and improved optimizations. This library optimizes the scripts to take advtage of v8 and pre-compiles locales in separate scripts for blazing fast speeds.

- Playwright runs 100% faster than puppeteer.


## Linting

Straight forward linting. You can pass a url or valid html.

Linting is handled on the same machine not sandboxed.

```js
import { a11yLint } from "a11y-js"

await a11yLint("https://a11ywatch.com");

```

## Testing

The [test-results](./test-results/) are checked in to avoid hindering performance on updates. The comparison between using `fast_htmlcs`, `fast_axecore`, and the metrics for the 3rd party `@axe-core/playwright`.
 
1. `yarn build:test`

## Benchmarks

1. `fast_htmlcs` runs over 110 times base faster than htmlcs or HTML codesniffer.
1. `fast_axecore` runs over 30%-100%+ base faster than the original axe by default and scales the larger the website.

Currently `fast_htmlcs` runs around 50x faster than axe-core and has several differences of handling the way issues are found. They both capture different cases and is best to used together which this library handles efficiently. We use [swc](https://swc.rs/) to minify the scripts for small bundle sizes under 142kb for HTMLCS compared to the original being 365kb. 

If you use [`@playwright/axe-core`](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/accessibility-testing) you can swap it out with the following [playwright-axe-example](./a11y-js/tests/basic-axe-playwright.spec.ts) and get an increase in issues found and major performance boost of at least 100%. You can also include multiple runners to extend the issues beyond the basics in folds.

## Developing

In order to develop you need yarn v2 installed for the workspace.

Run the following to install on ^node@16.10

`corepack enable && corepack prepare yarn@stable --activate` and reload shell after.

Use the command `./build.sh` to compile all the scripts for each locale.

## About

This project took Axecore and HTMLCS from versions that were complete and semi-stable.
We patched and fixed a lot of bugs that increased the accuracy of tests passing and issues being found.
One of the main goals was to have the audit run quickly since we noticed some of the tests would take several seconds to
complete. The performance increases we made to the project were not only done at edge cases that would scale beyond
make the ability of auditing at the MS level for almost any website. Right now, the project is moving forward based on performance
and accuracy for ensuring minimal to no false positives.

## Teleportation like Speeds

As we set the foundation to mark test cases that can pass and increase our target on automating accessibility we have a couple of layers that 
can make a major difference to the project. The following will save drastic time and money if done.

1. Use a fast [crawler](https://github.com/a11ywatch/crawler) to gather all of the html to send to a web accessibility service that can perform audits like [pagemind](https://github.com/a11ywatch/pagemind) over CDP.

2. Pre-compile the scripts to the browser so that you are not sending it over the wire per request and simply performing the audit as a side effect for navigating like a chrome extension.

### Experimental Todo

Using the dom and javascript to perform the evals is a bit expensive. We need javascript usage from a real browser to accurate render the markup and display the things 
that need to be tested. Beyond the point of rendering we do not need javascript, which leads to using [wasm](https://webassembly.org/) to evaluate the markup could perform 
better especially for larger websites.
